## Hello World!

This is our first post in this blog, I will introduce a little bit about **Elanode**(/…õÀàlan≈çd/).

So, **Elanode** is a digital creative agency based in Indonesia üáÆüá©, in Tangerang to be exact. It was officially established in the early of 2022 and we already have some projects from clients beforehand. We already have multiple clients from small medium enterprises as well as large corporate companies.

According to [_DataReportal_](https://www.statista.com/topics/2431/internet-usage-in-indonesia/), Indonesia, as of January 2021, there were around 202.6 million of internet users among 274.9 million of total population. That means ~73% of Indonesian people, uses the internet in their daily life. Whilst worldwide, today we also have around 5 billion of internet users ([source](https://datareportal.com/global-digital-overview)).

The high amount of internet users worldwide means that, everybody is using the internet either for their work, businesses, entertainment, social, etc. that's also means, we are rapidly moving into the era of digitalization.

In simple words, why **Elanode** was founded is, **Elanode** wants to help anyone who is looking for a transformation in their businesses, to thrive through the era of digitalization. 

Our services that can help to achieve the transformation are like, software development, website development, graphic design, branding concepts, social media management, mobile app development, platform UI/UX mock ups, etc..
